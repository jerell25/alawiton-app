    "lyrics": "Verse 1:\nO Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder\nConsider all the worlds Thy hands have made;\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder\nThy power throughout the universe displayed. \n\nChorus:\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!\n\nVerse 2:\nWhen through the woods, and forest glades I wander\nAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees; \nWhen I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,\nAnd hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.\n\nVerse 3:\nAnd when I think that God, His Son not sparing,\nSent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;\nThat on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing\nHe bled and died to take away my sin.",
